                     I am jerusheya, a bud from a small village near Western Ghats.
            I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated, reliable, responsible and hard-working person.
      A person who loves to travel the most. My most interesting thing is to watch movies and series. 
                I am really into it. I am very good team player and great at organising events. 
        I love English movies a lot. I vastly improved the productivity of my skills by ensuring 
                a work-life balance. I believes mindfulness in the workplace is key to success, 
            I lives out through my interests in painting, traveling, dancing and watching movies. 
          I have huge hunger for knowledge and determination to turn information into action has 
                              contributed to my most success from childhood.
                              "Determination and Dedication is note-worthy"
